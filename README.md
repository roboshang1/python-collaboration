# Python-Collaboration: Currency Converter
Authors: Zach + Charles, Course: EECE2140 Computing Fundamentals for Engineers, Project: Currency Converter Final Project

Project Overview: 
This project is a real-time currency converter built with Python. It uses the ExchangeRate-API to fetch live exchange rates and features a user-friendly Tkinter GUI for intuitive interaction. The application allows users to convert between currencies, view supported currencies, and perform multiple conversions in a single session.

Features: 
Real-Time Exchange Rates: Fetches the latest rates from the ExchangeRate-API.
Dynamic Currency List: Displays supported currencies, updated directly from the API.
